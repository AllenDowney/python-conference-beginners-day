# Getting the best out of the conference

“Getting the best out of the conference” session (30 mins) -- suggested talks, don’t be afraid to ask stupid questions, what is an open space, what is a birds-of-a-feather session, etc

- suggested talks.
- don't worry about missing them!  the "hallway track"
- asking questions (don't be afraid to interrupt a conversation and ask for a few basic explanations)
- lunch: don't be scared to rock up to a table and introduce yourself and ask what everyone's talking about
- same for saying hi to anyone that's standing around on their own.  (if they really wanted to be alone to do work or something, they'd be sitting down)
- stop by the poster session and chat with other Pythonistas about their work
  in a low key setting
