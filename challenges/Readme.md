# Python Challenges

These challenges are aimed at people who've already learned the basics of Python.  They're meant to encourage you to use some of the more interesting features of Python, and help you to write more "Pythonic" code...

# Python challenges in this repo

[magic methods](magic_methods.py)  - learn how to make your classes Pythonic using magic methods like `__len__` and more

[decorators](decorators.py) - decorators, a pretty way of transforming functions using other functions. functional programming!

[context managers](context_managers.py) - aka the "with" statement.  What's it for, and how does it help to make your code look nicer?

[The Game of Life](life.md) - a programming classic.  Try it out using OO and functional paradigms in Python.


# Beyond Python - learning to use third party libraries

* Matplotlib to plot charts
* GEOJson to parse geographical data
* requests to get data off the internet
* scrapy for web scraping
* postgres as a database
* Tk for graphics and GUI stuff

and lots more...
